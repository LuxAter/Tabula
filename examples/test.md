# This is a section

Hello world! This is a test of how the python markdown system will interpret
the additional text.

!!! note "This is a NOTE"
    Here is some text in said note.

    Here is more text in the note.

Did that work? Lets try some code!

```python
import sys

def main():
  print("hello World!")
```

## Thats it

Thats it for now!...

WHat aboute inline `code`??? How does that turn out? And how about inline
math??? $$a^2-b_c$$. Did that work?
