# Introduction

Tabula is a system for generating reference documentation from markdown files.
Tabula is able to generate `HTML` or `LaTex` documentation from the set of
markdown files that are specified as the sources. It is possible to customize
the output of the documentation that is generated, by using a template
directory, which will be used to generate the output documentation.
