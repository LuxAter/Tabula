@func bool Foo(int a)
  This is a function that calls @ref fun:bar and uses that, by passing `a`. We
  will try to make it multi line and see what happens? I dont think that it
  will work very nicly.
  @param a int
    Test parameter. Lets try to have a very long description in the parmeter
    and see what happens then? Mabey add a parameter to this parameter?
    @param b void
      Haha I think that this will work!
  @return bool
    Randomized boolean value.
